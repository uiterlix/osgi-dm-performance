Knoplerfish seems to outperform equinox and felix in the current simple scenario.

Rough first findings
--------------------

Equinox: 100000 services, 1 consumer for a single service using a filter on a custom id property
--------
dm (no index)		: 2100
dm (with index)		: 2800
scr					: 3470
plain osgi lookup	: 1990

Equinox: 200000 services, 1 consumer for a single service using a filter on a custom id property
--------
dm (no index)		: 5830
dm (with index)		: 5050
scr					: 12800
plain osgi lookup	: 5680



Todo:
----
- figure out how to easily create a lot of consumers using scr (servicefactory)
- add ipojo consumer as well
